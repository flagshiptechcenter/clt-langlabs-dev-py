A brief history
---------------
 
This project is the code base of our new generation of BRIX system in College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature, University of Hawaii at Manoa.

The original site is built mainly for course management over the last decade. Over 60 courses or learning communities have been built for language learning, teacher training and intercultural exchange.

In order to get better user experience, more complex and innovative functions can be built specifically for language learing. 

This Django powered project makes it possible and easier to integrate with other future apps. Apps are almost seperated between each other.
